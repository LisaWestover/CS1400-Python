Software Development Life Cycle


1. Requirements specification
    input in a different way the length and number of sides
    display result with appropriate message to user
    use math() mods for pi, tan() and pow()
    output should be rounded to 5 decimal places using round()


2. System analysis
    create variables to input the length and number of sides inputs
    create calculation variables to run the formula through
    print statement to give the user the area (in 5 decimal places using round())


3. System design
    design a different way to input the length and number of sides
    maybe turtle can input??
    calc area
    display the area to the user (5 decimal places using round()


4. Testing
   2 test cases to run to assess the program

        Case 1:
            1. Input - test the input of the variables with correct float or decimal states
            2. Expected Output - test final answers that they are also correct as a float or decimal states
            3. Report of problems and how they were fixed.  Write "Passed" if passed on first try.

        Case 2:
            1. Input - test the calculation formulas to make sure there is no logical errors
            2. Expected Output - compare answers to teachers example
            3. Report of problems and how they were fixed.  Write "Passed" if passed on first try.
