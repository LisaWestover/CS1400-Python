Plan for random number guessing game

Software Development Life Cycle

1. Requirements specification
     - have user enter a number (1 - 10)
     - make sure it is really a number
     - output the reply based on how close they are
        Exact match: Honored to play with you, Master.
        Off by 1: You are a worthy opponent, Knight.
        Off by 2: You have much to learn, Padawan.
        Off by 3: Youngling, your time will come.
        Off by 3+: Keep working hard in the Service Corps.

2. System analysis
    Query user
    if statement to determine answer
    print answer


3. System design
    Print the Welcome message
    Query user for number
    Print a reply based on how close they are

4. Testing
   2 test cases to run to assess the program

        Case 1:
            1. test a word or a float to see if it will prompt the user for a valid number

        Case 2: look at chart to make sure the right response was given
