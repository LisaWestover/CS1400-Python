Social Situation

Software Development Life Cycle
1. Requirements specification
    a user inputs their name, location, and radius of their personal space using x, y coordinates
    a second user will do the same

    output if the personal space is violated and if there is overlap

2. System analysis
        obtain each users x, y coordinates
        calculate personal space zone for each person
            count total x,y spots
        loop though each user's  zone
            if each coodinate == user2
                 userXSpotCounter++         #to later determine if all their zones are filled, meaning entirely in space
                 userXPersonalSpace = 1   #to mark that persons space violated
        output the results

3. System design
        Print Welcome statement
        Indent the user reply information
        Query for Person 1 and 2 information
        Print a reply for personal space
        Print a reply for space overlap

4. Testing
   2 test cases to run to assess the program

        Case 1:
            1. Input - Compare answers to the teachers example to see if answers line up.
            2. Expected Output - Look at example on unit 3 assignment, compare teachers example to results.
            3. Report of problems and how they were fixed.  Write "Passed" if passed on first try.

        Case 2:
            1. Input - test the calculation to the distance formula to make sure there is no logical errors
            2. Expected Output - compare answers to teachers example
            3. Report of problems and how they were fixed.  Write "Passed" if passed on first try.
