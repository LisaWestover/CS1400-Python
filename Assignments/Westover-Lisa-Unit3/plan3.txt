Plan for Finding Fluky Numbers

Software Development Life Cycle


1. Requirements specification
    generate seeded random numbers from 1 - 100000
    take the sum of each to see if a funky number is generated
    record the start and stop time
    count the loops total

2. System analysis
    import random
    Use randseed() to start the reoccurring random numers
    Use randint() with a range of 1 to 10000
        do not exit the program until every random number is tested
    use a while loop to loop through a series of numbers starting with 1,
        see if the sum of those random numbers add up to be a fluky number
    record the start and end time in seconds
    count how many loops were needed in the program


3. System design
    setup the random numbers
    collect the begin start time
    setup the while loop
    sum the random numbers and test for a funky number
    print the fluky numbers as they are found
    collect the time and compare with beginning time
    print the time it took to do entire calculation
    print the total loops it took
