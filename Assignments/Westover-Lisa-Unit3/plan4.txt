Plan for Elephants


Software Development Life Cycle

1. Requirements specification
     - simulate 100,000
        1st elephant randomly entering 1 0f 6 stalls
        2nd element randomly entering 1 of 6 stalls
        zookeeper randomly entering 1 of 6 stalls

        keep a counter of how many times the zookeeper sees both elephants
        calculate the percentages

2. System analysis
    run the random.randint() in a for loop 100,000 against all three elements
     increment a counter everytime the zookeeper enters a stall that has both elephphants in it
     calculate the percentage against the 100,000 tests
     print results
     prompt to run the simulation again at the end of the loop

3. System design
    Begin with a printed statement saying what it does
    print the percentages as the simulation runs
    print the final results
    prompt to run it again or quit
